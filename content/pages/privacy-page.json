      "text": "This website has been designed and developed by Morph specifically for this clinical trial. We understand that your privacy is important to you and that you care about how your personal data is used. We respect and value the privacy of all of our customers and suppliers’ data and will only collect and use personal data in ways that are described here, and in a way that is consistent with our obligations and your rights under the law.\n\n## 1. Information about us\n\nMorph is a partnership.\n\nMain trading address: The Brae, 2 Castle Road, Kendal, LA9 7AU\n\nVAT Reg: 100 5588 46\n\nData Protection Officer: Matthew Brook\n\nEmail address: info@morph.co.uk\n\nTelephone number: 01524 88 42 88\n\nPostal Address: The Brae, 2 Castle Road, Kendal, LA9 7AU\n\n## 2. What does this policy cover?\n\nThis Privacy Policy relates specially to this website only and explains how we use your personal data on the site: how it is collected, how it is held, and how it is processed. It also explains your rights under the law relating to your personal data.\n\n## 3. What is personal data?\n\nPersonal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier’. Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers. The personal data that we use is set out in Part 5, below.\n\n## 4. What are your rights?\n\nUnder the GDPR, you have the following rights, which we will always work to uphold:\n\n1. The right to be informed about our collection and use of your personal data. This Privacy Policy should tell you everything you need to know, but you can always contact us to find out more or to ask any questions using the details in Part 11.\n2. The right to access the personal data we hold about you. Part 10 will tell you how to do this.\n3. The right to have your personal data rectified if any of your personal data held by us is inaccurate or incomplete. Please contact us using the details in Part 11 to find out more.\n4. The right to be forgotten, i.e. the right to ask us to delete or otherwise dispose of any of your personal data that we have. Please contact us using the details in Part 11 to find out more.\n5. The right to restrict (i.e. prevent) the processing of your personal data.\n6. The right to object to us using your personal data for a particular purpose or purposes.\n7. The right to data portability. This means that, if you have provided personal data to us directly, we are using it with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed using automated means, you can ask us for a copy of that personal data to re-use with another service or business in many cases.\n8. Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling. We do not use your personal data in this way.\n\nFor more information about our use of your personal data or exercising your rights as outlined above, please contact us using the details provided in Part 11.\n\nFurther information about your rights can also be obtained from the Information Commissioner’s Office or your local Citizens Advice Bureau.\n\nIf you have any cause for complaint about our use of your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.\n\n## 5. What personal data do we collect when you visit this website?\n\nYou may visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about you. The website is hosted by Netlify and their servers log the IP addresses of all requests for security purposes. These logs are stored for less than 30 days and are not used to identify individuals. \n\nNetlify is committed to helping users understand the General Data Protection Regulation and to comply with its requirements and Morph have entered into a legally binding Data Protection Agreement with Netlify to ensure that this is the case (https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa)\n\n[Cookie Policy](/cookies)\n\n## 6. How do we use your personal data?\n\nUnder the GDPR, we must always have a lawful basis for using personal data. This may be because the data is necessary for our performance of a contract with you, because you have consented to our use of your personal data, or because it is in our legitimate business interests to use it. Your personal data may be used for one of the following purposes:\n\n* IP addresses are required by Netlify to troubleshoot a number of issues, such as connectivity issues, tracking down specific HTTP responses, tracking DDoS attacks.\n\n## 7. How long will we keep your personal data?\n\nIP addresses are logged for no more than 30 days.\n\n## 8. How and where do we store or transfer your personal data?\n\nWe may store or transfer some or all of your personal data in countries that are not part of the European Economic Area (the “EEA” consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein). These are known as “third countries” and may not have data protection laws that are as strong as those in the UK and/or the EEA. Morph have signed a Data Protection Agreement with Netlify to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the GDPR.\n\n## 9. Do we share your personal data?\n\nNo.\n\n## 10. How can I access my personal data?\n\nMorph do not have access to IP addresses logged by Netlify.\n\n## 11. How do I contact you?\n\nTo contact us about anything to do with your personal data and data protection, including to make a subject access request, please use the following details (for the attention of Matthew Brook):\n\nEmail address: info@morph.co.uk\n\nTelephone number: 01524 88 42 88\n\nPostal Address: The Brae, 2 Castle Road, Kendal, LA9 7AU\n\nPursuant to Article 27 of the European Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) General Data Protection Regulation, VeraSafe has been appointed as Netlify’s representative in the European Union and United Kingdom for data protection matters.
